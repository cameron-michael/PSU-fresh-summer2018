	<p><strong>Bio:</strong><p>
    <p>Cameron is looking for a design job that prides on visual identity and seeing things from a different perspective. As a multi-tasker he enjoys working on many projects at once, so don’t expect him to get tied down on one at a time. His guilty pleasures are cheesy puns and funyuns. When he grows up, he wants to be a standup comedian.</p>
