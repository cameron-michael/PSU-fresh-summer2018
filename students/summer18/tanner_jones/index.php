	<p><strong>Bio:</strong><p>
    <p>Tanner’s biggest turn ons are materials, and how they can effect your perspective of a project. He loves pushing the boundaries of projects and what can be done! He's looking for a small/ medium size agency that will push and challenge him to become a better designer every day! But still let his goofy side come out. When he grows up he wants to be an art director.</p>
