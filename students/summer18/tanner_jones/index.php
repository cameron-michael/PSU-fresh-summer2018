	<p><strong>Bio:</strong><p>
    <p>Tanner’s biggest turn ons are materials, and how they can effect your perspective of a project. He loves pushing the boundaries of projects and what can be done! He's looking for a small/medium size agency that will push and challenge him to become a better designer every day! But still let his goofy side come out. When he grows up he wants to be an art director.</p>

    <h2>Neon Zine</h2>
	<br>
    <p>With this project we went to the Oregon Historical Society. We were allowed to create a zine on any display. I chose to do mine on the 60's, specifically the neon signs on Portland. The pages are rise printed, and the cover is screen printed on vellum.</p>

    <h2>2019 Calendar</h2>
	<br>
    <p>Here is my 2019 calendar I created as a personal project. All of the illustrations were from a "poster a week" project I started for myself.</p>

    <h2>World's Most Annoying Passengers</h2>
	<br>
    <p>This is my taxonomy project about the different types of people you encounter on an airplane. It was originally a poster but I converted it into a magazine mockup. All of the illustrations were done separately on vellum, then digitized and stitched together.</p>
