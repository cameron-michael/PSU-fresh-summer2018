    <p>Andrea is looking for a special job that allows her to provide an outlet for people who don’t have a voice, inspires her every day, and allows her to grow as a designer and a human. Her guilty pleasure is print layout combined with bold and bright typography with a little spunk sprinkled in for good measure. When she grows up, she wants to help her Latin Community grow and inspire by having her own studio.</p>
