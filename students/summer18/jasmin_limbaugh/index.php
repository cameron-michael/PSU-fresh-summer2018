    <p>Jasmin is looking for that special job that will nurture and inspire her both as a designer and
individual. She loves trying new things and challenging herself to see beyond what is expected.

Secretly she is hoping someone will realize how funny she is and have her do naming and tag-
lines. When she grows up, she wants to be as free and fearless as when she was little.</p>
