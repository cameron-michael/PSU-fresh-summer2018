	<p><strong>Bio:</strong><p>
    <p>Gabriel Contreras is his name, but also known as GUP in the streets. Don’t get it twisted with “cup” because he drinks tea with his pinky up. When he isn't drinking tea or designing he is either painting, breaking or taking pictures. Interested in working with people doing inspiring work and not scared to get their hands dirty. When he grows up, he wants to be a student.</p>
