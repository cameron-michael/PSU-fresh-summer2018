	<p><strong>Bio:</strong><p>
    <p>Anna is an obsessive researcher by day and a netflix-and-coder by night. She is looking for a job at a small firm or an in-house position where she can wear a lot of hats (physically and metaphorically). Turn ons include color coding, being bossy and getting stuff done. Her guilty pleasure is succeeding at things where she has previously failed. When she grows up she wants to be a master gardener.</p>

    <h2>GameKeeper</h2>
	<br>
    <p>GameKeeper is an app designed to help boardgamers keep track of who they've loaned their games out to, and who they might be able to borrow games from. The creation of this app sprung from my love of my vast library of weird and rare boardgames and my love of sharing them! </p>
